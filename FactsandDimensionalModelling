#start postgres
start_postgres
#create a database named billingDW
createdb -h localhost -U postgres -p 5432 billingDW

In the above command

-h mentions that the database server is running on the localhost
-U mentions that we are using the user name postgres to log into the database
-p mentions that the database server is running on port number 5432

Step 3: Download the schema .sql file.

run this command
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0260EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Working%20with%20Facts%20and%20Dimension%20Tables/star-schema.sql

Create the schema
psql  -h localhost -U postgres -p 5432 billingDW < star-schema.sql
